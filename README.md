# Difficulty of Travelling to School Now for Student Commuters Compared to Pre-Pandemic

A data analysis project to identify the studentâ€™s opinion about the difficulty of travelling to school now compared to Pre-Pandemic times (For Public Commuters)

The project is divided into five different weeks because it is a part of a five-week data analysis course that I took.

The entire data analysis project is on the excel file uploaded.
